**********************Function Overloading***************
in function overloading function signature(function declaration without return type) is considered.

in which function name must be same.

but parameters must be different in following one way:
1)no of parameters different Or
2)datatypes of parameters Or
3)sequence of datatypes parameter.

constructor is also a function that's why we can overload constructor too.




name mangling happens compile time depends on parameter.





Function overloading is a feature of object oriented programming where two or more 
functions can have the same name but different parameters.


In Function Overloading “Function” name should be the same and the arguments should be different.

Function overloading can be considered as an example of polymorphism feature in C++.
