bitwise copying is also known as shallow copying.

Copy constructor - Copy constructor is a constructor which takes same type of object as a parameter.

We can implement copy constructor using reference variable.

We must use reference variable in copy constructor because if we do not 
use 
 recursion 
occur and that recursion detect at compile time and compilation error appears.

* Why we need copy constructor - 
    
           to avoid shallow copying and if necessary go for deep copying.
