Abstract class:

abstract class is class where class/types exist but object doesn't exist.

We can use such class with inheritance and also we can implement polymorphism.

we can  not create an object (instantiate) of such class but we can create pointer of such classes.


abstract class must be inherited and abstract function must be over ridden

pure virtual function-
in pure virtual function did not have body we have to declare it to zero


function have declaration but not have definition/body called pure virtual function.

how to implement abstract class?
by writing abstract function inside that 

what is abstract function - abstract function is pure virtual function.

what is pure virtual function - pure virtual function is a function which does not have definition
or body but have declaration.

syntax 

virtual return type function Name() = 0;    //virtual keyword is imp
