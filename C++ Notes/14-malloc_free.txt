stack frames does not share memory.
heap memory share memory between stack.
heap memory is runtime memory.


malloc()-allocate memory on heap.
basically malloc is function it not having syntax but it has declaration.


malloc is a function which recieve no of bytes as integer it allocate those many no of
bytes on heap sequentially and returns base address of that allocation. (eg. declaration of
malloc- void*malloc(int))


initialization-
int* ptr;
ptr=(int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*arraysize);
     typecasting

heap memory is programmer's responsibility.


free()
 free deallocate the memory present on heap and make it available for reallocation.

Dangling Pointer-

 A pointer pointing to a memory location that has been deleted (or free) is called dangling pointer.




Dynamic Memory Allocation can be defined as a procedure in which 
the size of a data structure (like Array) is changed during the runtime.
