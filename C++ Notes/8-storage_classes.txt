Storage classes 
storage classes are used to describe feature of a variable or function . they describe scope, visibility 
and life time of a particular variable

4 storage classes

1)Auto - this is default storage class for all variable e.g. int count and auto int count have same meaning.

2)Register- register storage class is used to define local variable that should be store in register instead of
RAM. Register used for variables that require quick access. 

3)Extern-When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function,
 which will also be used in other files, 
then extern will be used in another file to
 provide the reference of defined variable or function.

4)Static-when static is used on a global variable, it causes only one copy of that member
 to be shared by all the objects of its class.
