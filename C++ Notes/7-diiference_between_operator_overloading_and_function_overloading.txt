Difference Between Function Overloading And Function Overriding-



Function overriding is basically we used at runtime polymorphism

in overriding function  have same name but we have to declare base class function as virtual



in function overloading function also have same name but they are different by following one way

1)no of parameter should different
2)data types of parameter should different
3)sequence of parameter should different
