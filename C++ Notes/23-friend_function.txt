Friend Function - 
                    In cpp we can declare entire function or class 
as a friend of another class.

ordinary function which not member of a class cannot access private data
of a class but making that function friend of a that class
we can achieve this

class Distance {
    private:
        int meter; 
    public:
        Distance(): meter(0){ }
        friend int func(Distance); //friend function 
};

int func(Distance d){
    //function definition
    d.meter=10; //accessing private data from non-member function
    return d.meter; 
}

int main(){ 
Distance D;
cout<<"Distance: "<<func(D);
    system("pause"); 
    return 0;
