Initializer list is used in initializing data member of a class the list of member to be initialized is indicated with constructor as comma-separated list followed by colon .
Constructor_name(data_type member_var):{member_var=local_var}
{
}
It check narrowing pushing bigger data into lower

There are situations where initialization of data member inside constructor doesnâ€™t work and initializer list must be used
Following are the situation
1)For initializing non  static const data member
2)For initialization of reference members
3)for initialization of data member which do not have default constructor
4)for initialization of base class member
5)when constructor parameter name is same as data member
6)
