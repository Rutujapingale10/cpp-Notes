Const data Member -
Constant data member cannot be changed once they initialized.




Const member function - 
Constant member function is used to restrict modification of data member inside class.
To make member function constant 'const' keyword is appended to the function prototype and also function definition header.

<return_type> <function name>() const   //declaration

 int get_data() const{
}//function definition within class

Function defination outside of class
<Return_type><className>::<function name>const
{
//function body
}

When function declared as const it can be called on any type of object (const+non-const)
Non const function can only called by non const type object.

Whenever object is declared as const , it needs to be initialised at the time of declaration. However, object initialization while declaration is possible only with help of constructor.
