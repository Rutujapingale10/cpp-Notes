Static Casting-
               This is the simplest type of cast which can be used. It Is compile time cast .

It does things like implicit type of conversions between types (float to
 Int ,pointer to void*) and it can also call explicit type conversion functions(or implicit ones).

e.g.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
   float f=3.5;
   int a=f;
   int b=static_cast<int>(f);
   cout<<b;
}

	1- We can convert one data type into another using casting.
	2- Static_cast is implicit type of casting .
	3- It is compile time casting .
 




Dynamic Casting -
            This cast is used for handling polymorphism .
You only need to used it when you are casting to derived class. This is exclusive used
in inheritance when you cast from based class to derived class.
