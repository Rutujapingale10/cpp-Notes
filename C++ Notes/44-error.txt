Syntax Error - 
Syntax errors are known as compilation errors as they occurred at the compilation time, or we can say that syntax error are thrown by compilers.

These errors are mainly occurred due to mistakes while typing or do not follow the syntax of specified programming language.   




Run time Error - Sometimes error exist during execution time even after successful compilation known as run time error 
When program is running and even after not able to perform operation is the main cause of run time error .

e.g. - Division by Zero is the main cause the run time error 

Linker Error - Linker Errors are mainly generated when executable files of program not created 
This can be either happen due to the wrong function prototyping or usage of the wrong header file.

Eg .
	main.c contains sub function whose declaration and defination is done in some other file such as fun.c() 
	At the time of compilation the compiler find sub function in fun.c file, so it generate two files i.e. main.o and fun.o
	If at execution time defination of sub function is not found in fun.o then compiler throw linker error.
	
	Most common linker error occure when we use Main instead of main
	
	Logical Error - 
	
	When code is error free but producing wrong or undesired outputâ€¦ these errors are called logical errors.
	
	Semantic Error -
		Semantic Errors are errors that occurred when statements are not understandable by compiler.
		
		Eg. int b = "java"
