Virtual function- 
A C++ virtual function is a member function 
in the base class that you redefine in a derived class. 
It is declared using the virtual keyword.


There is a necessity to use the single pointer to refer to all 
the objects of the different classes.
 So, we create the pointer to the base class that refers to all the derived objects. 
But, when base class pointer contains the address of the derived class object,
 always executes the base class function. 
This issue can only be resolved by using the 'virtual' function.



Rules of a virtual functions

Virtual functions must be members of some class.
Virtual functions cannot be static members.
They are accessed through object pointers.
They can be a friend of another class.
A virtual function must be defined in the base class, even though it is not used.
