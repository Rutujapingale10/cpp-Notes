*************Pointer************
definition-
     pointer is a special type of variable which hold address of another variable.
  
Size of pointer -
       Size of pointer does not depends on datatype of pointer because 
pointer store address and all addresses are UNSIGNED 
 integer.

 The datatype of a pointer specifies the strength of pointer, depending 
on which pointer can access(read, write, edit) a variable.

Strength - how many bytes pointer can access from given(stored, passed) address.

*The pointer which is not initialized is called wild pointer.
*Wild pointer does unauthorized access.
*unauthorized access leads following cases:
1)Program may run smoothly
2)Program may produce garbage value or unexpected output.
3)Program may crash 


The biggest advantage of pointer is it can access (read, write, edit) a variable beyond the stack frame
if address is given/passed correctly.
