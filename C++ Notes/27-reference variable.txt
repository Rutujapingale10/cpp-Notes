****************Reference Variable*************

Reference variable - Reference variable is considered as nickname given to Existing variable.

reference variable does not have its own memory.

The biggest advantage of reference variable is it can access refferred variable beyond the limitation of stack frame.

reference variable must be initialised using some another existing variable (we cannot initialised reference variable
using value ).


once we initialised reference variable using its syntax after that it can be used as any normal variable or object with normal syntax.

we cannot declare reference variable we must initialised it.


Syntax - 
	int a=10;
      int &b =a;  

We can not modify reference variable once we initialised it will throw compilation error
