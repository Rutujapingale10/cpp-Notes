An inline function is a regular function that is defined by inline keyword.

The code for inline function is inserted directly into the code for calling function by compiler while compiling, which can 
Result in faster execution and less overhead compare to regular function calls.

Instead of calling function the statement of functions are pasted in calling functions.
Used with small size functions So that are small (handled automatically by compiler  optimisation level).
  



Inline functions are used to reduced function call overhead. A inline function is a function that is expanded in a line when it is called. 

When inline function is called whole code of inline function gets inserted or substituted at point of inline function call.
This substitution is performed by inline function call.

This substitution is performed by c++ compiler at compile time.

	• Inlining is a only request to a compiler not a command. The compiler can ignore request for inlining in following cases: 
		
		1)If functions a loop (for,while,do while)
		2)If a function contains static variable.
		3)if a function is recursive.
		4)if a function return type is other than void , and return statement doesn’t exist in function body.
		5)If function contains a switch or goto statement.
