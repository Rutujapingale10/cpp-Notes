Const Keyword- 
	The const keyword is declared the variable ,function, or object is immutable i.e. its value cannot be changed after 
	Initialisation .
	
	i.e. if you declared variable as const int x=5, you cannot modify the value of x later in program any attempt to modify value will result in compilation error.
	
	You can declare a fusion as const , which does not modify the state of object it is called on.
	Compiler may be able to stored const variable in read only memory which result in faster access time.
	
	-cont int a = 5;
	Initialisation can be done but we cant re-assign  the value.
	
	- Const with pointers - 
	-  cont int* a = new int[2]; //const data non const pointer 
	- *a =20 //cant change the content of pointer
	- Int b = 20; a=&b ;//pointer itself can be reassigned 
	
	
	
	   
	
	 



**Const parameter allows to overload member function and normal function but it should be reference / pointer.
C++ allows to overload member functions on the basis of Const and non-const.
