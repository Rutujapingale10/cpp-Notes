Memset() is a C++ function. It copies single character for specified no of times to an object.
It is useful for filling no of bytes with given value starting from specific memory location.
It is defined in <cstring> header file.

  char str[] = "geeksforgeeks";
    memset(str, 't', sizeof(str));
    cout << str;

We can use memset() to set all values as 0 or -1 for integral data types also. It will not work if we use it to set as other values. The reason is simple, memset works byte by byte
