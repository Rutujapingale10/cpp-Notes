2)strcpy(destination,source)-copies the content of source string to destination string.

   in first string.
4)strcmp(first_string,second_string) - compare first string with second string if both string are equal return 0;

String::npos
It is constant static member value with highest possible value for element of size type size_t
It is actually mean until the end of string
It is used as value for length parameter in the string's member function
 As return value, it is used to indicate no matches
String::npos is defined with -1 value because size_t is unsigned int and its highest value is -1
