It is a feature of C++11. 
With the help of this function we can create tiny, anonymous function that may be utilized as code snippets or as parameter to other function.

Creating and using short anonymous functions is simpler 
[capture list](parameters) mutable->return type
{
//body
}   
-Capture List :

 Capture list is optional, defines which variables from the surrounding scope the lambda expression may access.
  
-Mutable specifier-
Mutable specifier is also optional 

	- Parameter - 
	- The inputs to lambda expression are specified by parameter which are same as any other function
Return Type 
 lambda expression's return type is also specified by optional return type. The compiler will infer return type from the body of lambda expression if it is not given.

Body 
   when lambda expression is called , it will run the code in body.
