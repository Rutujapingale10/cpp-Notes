1)constructor is a special type of function which gets called
automatically at the time of object creation.

2)for each object constructor called separately and only once.

3)constructor has same name as class name.

4)constructor does not have return type (not even void).

5)constructor used to initialized object (that is to provide initialized state).

6)constructor used to allocate memory.



case-
1)when there is no programmer define constructor built in by default
 constructor is given.
2)Default constructor is available but parameterised is not available. we can 
create default i.e. zero arguments object but we cannot create parameterised object
3)Default  and parameterised both are available. :we can create both types of objects.
4)when we don't write default but writes a parameterised constructor only 
we can create only parameterised object.




Constructor types:
1)built in constructor - built in constructor it provide gb values.

2)default constructor - constructor doesn't take any argument.it has no parameter.

3)parameterised constructor - constructor with arguements. It has parameter.

4)copy constructor - which initializes an object using another object of the same class


Shallow copy and deep copy - 
In shallow copy two object are not  independent and in deep copy object are dependent.
